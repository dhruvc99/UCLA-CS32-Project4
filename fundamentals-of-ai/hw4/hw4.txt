The given graph i.e. graph1.txt is unsatisfiable with 3 colors. However,
it is indeed satisfiable with 4 colors. We can see that this is the case
by observing that node 1 in the graph has 4 neighbors.

An acceptable 4 coloring for graph1.txt is as follows:
1: blue
2: red
3: blue
4: red
5: green
6: yellow
7: green

Graph 2 is satisfiable with 8 or more colors.
