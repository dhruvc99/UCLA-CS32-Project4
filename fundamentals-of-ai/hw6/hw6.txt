1. 
(a)
{x/A, y/B, z/B}

(b)
No unification exists - substituting A/x leaves no unifier for B.

(c)
{x/John, y/John}

(d)
No unification exists - subsiting x/Father(y) leaves no unifier for y. 

2.
(a)
i. Ax Food(x) => Likes(John, x)
ii. Food(Apples)
iii. Food (Chicken)
iv. Ax(Ay Eats(x, y) & -MakesSick(y, x) => Food(y))
v. Ax(Ay MakesSick(x, y) => -Well(x))
vi. Eats(Bill, Peanuts) & Well(Bill)
vii. Ax Eats(Bill, x) => Eats(Sue, x)

(b) 
Ax Food(x) => Likes(John, x) gives us Ax -Food(x) | Likes(John, x)
Instantiating x on Apples, we get: -Food(Apples) | Likes(John, Apples) which gives us Likes(John, Apples)
Similarly for Chicken, we get: -Food(Chicken) | Likes(John, Chicken) which gives us Likes(John, Chicken)

(c) 

From vi, we have Eats(Bill, Peanuts), using which we instatintiate x on Peanuts in vii, giving us
Eats(Bill, Peanuts) => Eats(Sue, Peanuts) i.e. Eats(Sue, Peanuts)

3.
We have:
i. Mother(Mary, Tom)
ii. Alive(Mary)
iii. AxAy Mother(x, y) => Parent(x, y)
iv. AxAy (Parent(x, y) & Alive(x)) => Older(x, y)

Instantiating x to Mary and y to Tom and using i and iii we get Parent(Mary, Tom)
Using Parent(Mary, Tom) and ii we get Older(Mary, Tom) i.e Mary is older than Tom

4. 

     A2
   _|  |_      (arrows point downward)
  1      0
  |      |
  0      1


Splitting on A2 gives us the most information since A1 and A3 are ambiguous on both thier values.
