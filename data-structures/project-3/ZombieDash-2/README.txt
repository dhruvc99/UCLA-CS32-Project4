To run ZombieDash:

1. Locate the folder ZombieDash, which should have in it files named
ZombieDash and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/ZombieDash or /Users/yourname/Downloads/ZombieDash.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
	cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the ZombieDash
folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
	ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the ZombieDash executable.

4. Type
	./ZombieDash
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder ZombieDash, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the ZombieDash executable
file.
